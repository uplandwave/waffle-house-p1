# Sleep Out Side

Welcome to our team repo! Our team here at Waffle House is happy to show you what we have created.

## Description

SleepOutside is a simple web app with Vite support to bundle up our assets. 

## Our Team

## Setup

We are using pnpm because it works better for us. If you like npm feel free to change the `pnpm` in each command to `npm`.

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run start` starts up a local server and updates on any JS or CSS/SCSS changes.

## Other commands

- `pnpm run build` to build final files when you are ready to turn in.
- `pnpm run lint` to run ESLint against your code to find errors.
- `pnpm run format` to run Prettier to automatically format your code.
